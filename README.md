# announce-code-review

**announce-code-review** is a GitHub Action that automatically posts your pull requests for review at the CodeKeepers Discord Server via our proprietary API. This action performs a series of checks to ensure authenticity before triggering a review request.

## Features

- **Repository Privacy Check:**  
  Ensures that the repository is public.
- **Badge Verification:**  
  Checks that the repository's `README.md` contains the CodeKeepers badge (the "Join CodeKeepers" image) and verifies that it was committed by **Vulps22**.
- **Review Request Submission:**  
  If all checks pass, it sends a POST request to the CodeKeepers API endpoint with the pull request URL and repository owner details.

## Usage

- Join the [CodeKeepers Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uhvQpVmxeK) if you haven't done so already
- Complete the verification process by getting the Github Verified linked role and registering your project
- use `/secret generate` to generate a secret for your project
- Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/review-request.yml`) in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: CodeKeepers Review Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review_request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run announce-code-review Action
        uses: Vulps22/announce-code-review@v1.0.0
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
          pr_url: ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}
```

> **Note:**  
> - Make sure you add your API token in your repository secrets as `API_TOKEN`.

- Once your project meets all the requirements for approval, Vulps22 (Discord: vulps23) will sign your project with this image, Signifying your project is ready for review:

## What the Action Does

1. **Repository Privacy Check:**  
   Verifies that the repository is public. If it is private, the action exits.
2. **Badge Check:**  
   Searches the `README.md` for the "Join CodeKeepers" badge.
3. **Commit Verification:**  
   Uses `git blame` on the line containing the badge to confirm that it was committed by **Vulps22**.
4. **Review Request Submission:**  
   Sends a POST request to `https://vulps.co.uk/codekeepers/api/review-request` with a JSON payload that includes the pull request URL and the repository owner's username (fetched from the GitHub event context).
5. The CodeKeepers Discord bot will post your PR in the #pull-requests channel on discord so that others can review your code ðŸ™‚
